installation instructions:

first make sure that you had installed rails:  http://railsinstaller.org/en

if bundler exist(should be installed right now with rails install)





make sure that you have mysql installed :https://www.mysql.com/downloads/
if you prefer another db than change
 and install a gem for by gem install
database yml file 
the file look like this:

			default: &default
			  adapter: {your sql }
			  encoding: utf8
			  pool: 5
			  username: root
			  password: zxcdsa
			  host: localhost

			development:
			  <<: *default
			  database: {db name}

			# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
			# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
			# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
			test:
			  <<: *default
			  database: {db name}

			# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
			# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
			# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
			#
			# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
			# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
			# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
			# production deployment.
			#
			# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
			# available as an environment variable. For example:
			#
			#   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
			#
			# You can use this database configuration with:
			#
			#   production:
			#     url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
			#
			production:
			  <<: *default
			  database: {db name}
			  username: root
			  password: <%= ENV['SHARES_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %> 

run bundle install in your project folder for installing all gems

note somtimes there is a ssl error you can look for a fix in this link :http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10246023/bundle-install-fails-with-ssl-certificate-verification-error



you almost done

if  database.yml remain as default   generate database called mydb

now
all that remains is to run the command rake db:migrate for genreate all tables 
and than rake db:seed  for poplate them
